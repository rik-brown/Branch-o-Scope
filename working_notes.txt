The cells need do be splice once they have come to the end of their branch.
Maybe the best way to do this is to define a parameter passed into a 'seed cell' giving 'max nr. of generations'


Consider importing the 'colourshift' functionality from Cellendipity

The cell currently has no death() function, so it can only be killed from above
Need a way to kill the cell, even when it doesn't branching

The recursive event is basically the branching
The rest of the cell's life can be governed by it's own 'living rules'

Maybe a simple implementation is: keep branching until cell dies?
Cell only dies when death rules are met
